# Contributing

I really appreciate every contribution and suggestion, it can be code, documentation.
By the way, if anyone is interested to propose me a logo, don't hesitate to contact me.
Feel free to ask questions as well.

## Issues and suggestions

If you experience an issue or want to suggest a feature, [create an issue](https://github.com/scemino/engge/issues/new/choose)
to let others know. If you want to fix the issue by yourself, open a pull request instead.

## Contributing code

Try to match the coding style that's already present. I will try to create a .clang-format file that respect the current coding style.
